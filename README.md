# Java project

A project to review things as I go. The objective is to create the project as follows:

- Create an Item class
	- Encapsulated attributes (_private_)
	- Constructors
		- Empty
		- With parameters
	- Getters and setters
	- toString
- Create a Main class
	- Create 5 Items
	- Create an array with products
	- "Statistics"
		- Calculate the total sum
		- Calculate the average price

## Creating a basic 

A class with encapsulated attributes:

```java
public class Item {
	private String name;
	private int price;
	private Manufacturer manufacturer;
}
```

A basic constructor:

```java
public class Item {
	public Item() { }
}
```
